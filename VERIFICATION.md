\- omissions are intentional

\- interpretation is unambiguous



\## Current state



\- Automated checks: not included

\- Manual verification: expected



\## Minimum verification for elevation



Before WFSL elevation, this repository must:



1\. Be applied to at least one governed repo

2\. Demonstrate deterministic disclosure behaviour

3\. Maintain a tagged elevation baseline
