# WFSL Sentinel — Disclosure

## Purpose

This repository defines the **disclosure posture and non-assertion framework**
for Wynergy Fibre Solutions Ltd (WFSL).

It exists to make explicit what WFSL does and does **not** claim, ensuring that
external parties can distinguish description from assertion and posture from promise.

This repository is **normative**.

---

## Disclosure Philosophy

WFSL adopts an **explicit disclosure** approach.

This means:
- Claims are stated only where supportable
- Limits are stated as clearly as capabilities
- Silence is not used to imply assurance
- Documentation distinguishes fact from intent

Disclosure is treated as a governance control.

---

## Scope of Disclosure

Disclosure applies to:
- Public-facing repositories
- Governance and sentinel repositories
- Documentation that may be reviewed by third parties

Disclosure does NOT apply to:
- Internal communications
- Confidential operational detail
- Contractual terms unless explicitly stated

---

## Required Disclosures

Where applicable, repositories MUST:

- State their purpose and scope
- Identify intended audience
- Declare non-assertions explicitly
- Avoid ambiguous language that implies assurance

Repositories SHOULD:
- Prefer descriptive language over evaluative language
- Avoid forward-looking claims
- Avoid regulatory or certification language unless substantiated

---

## Non-Assertions (Global)

Unless explicitly stated elsewhere, WFSL repositories do NOT:

- Assert regulatory compliance
- Claim certification or approval
- Guarantee performance, security, or outcomes
- Represent contractual obligations
- Replace professional or legal advice

Any exception must be explicit, bounded, and independently verifiable.

---

## Handling External Interpretation

If a document may reasonably be interpreted as making a claim, it MUST:

- Clarify whether the statement is descriptive or assertive
- Identify the evidence supporting the claim, or
- State the limitation or uncertainty explicitly

Ambiguity is treated as a disclosure defect.

---

## Relationship to Other Sentinels

This repository complements:

- **sentinel-branch-policy**
- **sentinel-ci-baseline**
- **sentinel-inspection**

Together, they define how WFSL communicates, governs, and exposes itself to review.

---

## Audience

This repository is intended for:

- Legal reviewers
- Auditors and inspectors
- Counterparties performing due diligence
- Engineers authoring public documentation

It is not a marketing artefact.

---

## Status

Normative. Stable. Slow-moving.

Changes to this repository alter disclosure expectations
across the WFSL portfolio and therefore require elevated scrutiny.
