# sentinel-disclosure

**Deterministic disclosure and transparency baseline for governed systems.**

This repository is a Wynergyy incubation asset defining disclosure rules that ensure systems declare what they do, what they expose, and what they do not claim.

## Status

- Incubation: active
- Production claims: none
- Certification: none
- Support guarantees: none

## Purpose

This repository exists to:

- define mandatory disclosure boundaries
- prevent implied guarantees or hidden claims
- standardise transparency expectations
- support elevation into WFSL governance tooling

## What this is not

- Not a reporting service
- Not a compliance guarantee
- Not a certification authority
- Not a WFSL-certified asset

## Disclosure principles

- Declare capabilities explicitly
- Declare non-capabilities explicitly
- No implied behaviour
- Silence is not consent

## Elevation gate

This repository becomes eligible for WFSL elevation only when:

1. Licence is Apache License 2.0
2. Disclosure rules are explicit and testable
3. No implied guarantees exist
4. A tagged elevation baseline exists

## Licence
